title: FRF Currituck Sound, CS01 ADOP Currents
station_name: CS01-ADOP
summary: >
   USACE/COAB data collected by a bottom mounted (looking up) Nortek Aquadopp current profiler, at station CS01,
   Currituck Sound, Duck, NC at a nominal water depth of -3.265 m NAVD 88 and gauge depth of -3.08 m.  
   Profiles were average of 600 seconds of 1 Hz data collected every 1800 sec.
   Directional current profiles were interpolated to 0.4m intervals relative to NAVD88, and depth integrated currents are computed. 
   Data values start closest to the gauge and go upwards.  This instrument is hard-wired to an autonomous data acquisition system and analyzed 
   on one hour intervals.  Current directions are flowing towards clockwise fron true north (0 degrees is 
   flowing towards true north, 90 degrees to the east). 
   These data have been processed and QC checked with an automated analysis progran and should be considered preliminary.
