title: FRF Currituck Sound, CS01 SBE26+
summary: >
   Water level data Collected at the USACE Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL),
   Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC.
   These data were collected in the Currituck Sound at Station CS01
   with Seabird Electronics SBE 26+ wave and water level sensors.
   Data were sampled in 360 sample bursts at 1 Hz and statistics are computed by averaging within a burst
