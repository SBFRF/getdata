title: FRF Currituck Sound, CS03 Microcat
summary: >
   Water quality data collected at the USACE Coastal Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL),
   Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC.
   These data were collected in the Currituck Sound at Station CS03
   with Seabird Electronics Microcat SBE37-SIP
   Data were sampled at 1 sample every 5 min.
   Sensor oriented vertically and has inserts on conductivity cell
   to prevent biofouling.
