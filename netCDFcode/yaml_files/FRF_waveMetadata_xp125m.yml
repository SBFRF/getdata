title: FRF Paros Cross-Shore (125m) Sensor
summary: >
   USACE/CHL/COAB collected non-directional wave data using a Paroscientific pressure sensor
   the FRF (Duck, NC) cross-shore array (FRF cross-shore coordinates X=124.42, Y=939.26 m).  
   The sensor was buried in the beach to help reduce pressure bias from currents (Bernouli 
   effect).  Record are collected hourly, 34 minutes with long, starting at the top of the
   hour.  Data were sampled at 2 Hz.  Frequency spectra were computed using 512 point 
   ensembles and the Welch method of 50% ensemble overlap.  Spectra were smoothed with 
   3-point frequency band averaging then interpolated to 0.0075 Hz bands between 0.04 and 
   0.5 Hz.
   Paros frequency signals are converted to analog voltage using COAB frequency to
   voltage converters and collected with a 16-bit A/D data logger.
   If the Paros gauge is believed to be buried less than 15cm (or not buried) then a linear 
   wave theory pressure correction (PRF) is applied to the pressure spectra to get surface 
   variance spectra.  If the gauge is believed buried by more than 15 cm then a PRF for 
   burried sensors was applied using the Raubenheimer method (Raubenheimer, B., Elgar, S., 
   and Guza R.T. 1998.  Journal or Waterway, Port, Coastal, and Ocean Engineering.  Vol. 
   124, No. 3). PRF corrections exceeding 100x in energy are not applied at the high frequency 
   end of the spectra.
   Data that use the survey or nominal depths for pressure correcting should be considered 
   suspect (see the Zsource and depthTime variables).
